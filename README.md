### How to test:

In the file `test.py`, change `PATH` to the path of corresponding test set you want to test on. Then run ` test.py`.

The test set should be a list of dictionary where each dictionary contains at least `"py","hz"` which corresponds to the input and ground truth output.

```python
[
    {
        "hz": [
            "\u4e0d",
            "\u5c11",
            "\u654f\u611f",
            "\u7684",
            "\u8bfb\u8005",
            "\u731c\u6d4b",
            "\u8bf4"
        ],
        "py": [
            "bu",
            "shao",
            "mingan",
            "de",
            "duzhe",
            "caice",
            "shuo"
        ]
    }
]
```
